# Golang Backend Exercise

Welcome to the programming exercise for Golang Backend Developers! :)

## Your Task

Your task is to implement a very simple account management microservice using NestJS and TypeORM. It should at least be able to:

* Register new users using their email address, password, and name
* Log the user in using their email address and password
* Retrieve a list of all active users
* Change a user's name
* Delete a user

You can but do not have to include tests. Please use this repository as a starting point for your implementation and employ appropriate best practices.

As the functional requirements set above should be trivial to implement, we focus our evaluation on the quality of your code and architecture. Generally, your goal should be to get the service as close as possible to a production-ready state. This could, for example, include adding proper logging capabilities, metrics or health checks.

## Setup

Please make sure you have recent versions of `go` and `make` installed on your local machine.
  
You can run this service with `make run`, build it with `make build`, test it with `make test`. Please take a look into the `Makefile` to see all available operations.
